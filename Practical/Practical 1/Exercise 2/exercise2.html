    <!-- Many companies normally charge a shipping and handling fee for purchases. Create a script that calculates shipping and handling based on a value assigned to a variable called purchase.
    A minimum shipping and handling fee of 1.50 is added for any purchase less than or equal to 25.00. For a purchase over 25.00, add 10% to the total purchase price but do not include the 1.50 minimum shipping and handling fee.
    The formula for calculating a percentage is price * percent /100. Use the comparison and conditional operators for this exercise.
    After you have calculated the total cost of the order display it in an alert dialog box.
    Purchase price of 24 euros gives you 25.50
    Purchase price of 60 euros gives 66.00
    -->
    <script>
      let purchase = 60;
      purchase <= 25.0
        ? (purchase += 1.5)
        : (purchase += (purchase * 10) / 100);
      window.alert(
        "Your sales total with shipping and handling is â‚¬ " +
          purchase.toFixed(2)
      );
    </script>
